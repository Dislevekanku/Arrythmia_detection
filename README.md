# Arrhythmia Detection
## Introduction
<p>This project focuses on detecting arrhythmias using the MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital) ECG (Electrocardiogram) dataset. Arrhythmias are irregular heart rhythms that can have serious health implications, and early detection is essential.</p>

## Project Summary
<p>We are utilizing ECG data collected by BIH and MIT, which provides valuable insights into the heart's electrical activity. Here is a summary of the dataset:</p>

<li>Number of records: 48</li>
<li>Sampling frequency: 360 samples per second</li>
<li>Data Distribution: The dataset consists of records from 25 male subjects between the ages of 32 and 89 and 22 female subjects aged from 23 to 89 years. Approximately 60% of the subjects were inpatients.</li>

## Project Objectives
<p>Our primary aim is to develop a classification model capable of identifying five distinct classes of arrhythmias:</p>

<li>Normal (N)</li>
<li>Paced Beat (/)</li>
<li>Right Bundle Branch Block Beat (R)</li>
<li>Left Bundle Branch Block (L)</li>
<li>Premature Ventricular Beat (V)</li>

## Type of Problem
<p>This project addresses a classification problem within the realm of supervised learning. Given the ECG data and their associated labels, the model will learn to classify ECG signals into one of the five arrhythmia classes.</p>

## Tools and Frameworks
<p>The project relies on several tools and libraries, including:</p>

<li>WFDB (WaveForm DataBase) for ECG data management.</li>
<li>PyTorch for building and training deep learning models.</li>
<li>Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
<li>Seaborn for data visualization.</li>
<li>py-ecg-detector for ECG peak detection.</li>
<li>imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced datasets.</li>

## Implementation Steps
<p>The key steps involved in building the arrhythmia detection system are as follows:</p>

<li><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> We segment each ECG record by detecting peaks and extracting a window of data around each peak.</li>

<li><b>Feature Engineering:</b> Transforming the peak information into feature vectors with a lower dimensionality, making the data suitable for model input.</li>

<li><b>Model Training:</b> Developing machine learning and deep learning models for arrhythmia classification. This project explores various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including:

<li><b>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):</b> A versatile and powerful model for classification tasks.</li>
<li><b>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):</b> A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for sequential data.</li>
<li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):</b> A deep learning architecture effective for image and signal processing.</li>
</li>
<li><b>Evaluation and Reporting:</b> Assessing model performance using relevant metrics and exploring hyperparameter tuning approaches.<lli>

## Hyperparameter Tuning Approaches
<p>To optimize model performance, we consider various hyperparameter tuning methods, including:</p>

<li><b>Grid Search:</b> A systematic search through a range of hyperparameters.</li>
<li><b>Random Search:</b> Randomized search for hyperparameters.</li>
<li><b>Bayesian Optimization:</b> Sequential model-based optimization for efficient hyperparameter tuning.</li>

## Signal Pre-Processing Techniques
<p>To extract meaningful information from ECG signals, we employ the following pre-processing techniques:</p>

<li><b>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):</b> A mathematical technique for transforming ECG data into the frequency domain.</li>
<li><b>Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT):</b> A signal processing approach to extract features from ECG data.</li>
<li><b>Feature Vectors (Simpson's Rule):</b> Calculation of feature vectors using Simpson's Rule for integration.</li>

## Machine Learning Approaches

<p>We explore several machine learning algorithms in this project, including:</p>

<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>

<li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</li>

## Summary
<p>This project aims to develop a robust arrhythmia detection system using a combination of machine learning and deep learning methods. By applying these techniques to the MIT-BIH ECG dataset, we aspire to contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Our exploration of ANN, LSTM, and CNN algorithms enhances our ability to achieve accurate and efficient arrhythmia detection, which can have a significant impact on healthcare and patient well-being.</p>
